## <a id="toc-intro"></a>Introduction
---
GitHub Actions allows to implement custom logic without having to create an app to perform the task and can remove the requirements of external CI platforms.

## <a id="toc-workflow"></a>Workflows
---
Workflows are a composite of many different GitHub Actions, or tasks. The following sections explain
some of the workflows we use in Melody.

Workflows are located in `main.workflow` under `.github` directory on root level of this repository.

#### <a id="toc-pr"></a>Pull request
This workflow only triggered by the pull request, using following events:

- opened
- reopened
- synchronies

Also, On every event, we runs the **build**, **lint**, **unit tests**, **e2e** and publish the **canary dist-tag** on npm registry. This tag can be used for testing purposes. 

#### <a id="toc-pr-closed"></a>Pull request closed
This workflow removes the **Canary dist-tag** which we publish in the [Pull request](#toc-pr) workflow. As the pull request can be merged or closed, the dist-tag will no longer in use. The successful merge in any other branch will publish the **prerelease dist-tag** or **canary dist-tag**.

#### <a id="toc-master-branch-only"></a>Master branch only
This workflow performs all the tasks mentioned in (Pull request workflow)[#toc-pr], but in the end it publishes **prerelease dist-tag** to npm registry.

#### <a id="toc-non-master-branch"></a>Non-Master branch
This workflow performs runs basic tasks like build, lint and test. It does not publish any tag to npm registry. 

Note: This workflow also runs whenever any new git tag is pushed.

#### <a id="toc-release"></a>Release
This workflow is used for release and **publishes latest dist-tag** on npm registry. It runs when any new release is created on github website. 

#### To make a release:
- Make sure you are on master and have `push` access.
- Make a commit in `vX.X.X' format. eg. ```git commit -m "v2.1.0"```

#### <a id="toc-node-versions"></a>Node 6, 10 & 11
